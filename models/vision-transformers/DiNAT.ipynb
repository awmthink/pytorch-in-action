    "## 模型概述\n",
    "\n",
    "Dilated Neighborhood Attention Transformer (DiNAT) 是一种创新的分层视觉Transformer，旨在提升深度学习模型的性能，尤其是在视觉识别任务中的表现。与传统Transformer使用的自注意力机制不同，DiNAT引入了Dilated Neighborhood Attention (DiNA)，在无需增加计算量的情况下，将局部注意力机制扩展为稀疏的全局注意力。这一扩展使DiNA能够捕捉更多的全局上下文，指数级地扩大感受野，并有效地建模长距离依赖关系。\n",

    "    <p>图1：DiNAT 架构示意图。</p>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "如上图所示：DiNAT 它首先将输入下采样到其原始空间分辨率的四分之一，然后将它们送入 4 级 DiNA Transformer 编码器。特征图在各级之间被下采样到其空间尺寸的一半，而通道数则翻倍。DiNAT 层与大多数 Transformer 类似：先是注意力机制，接着是带有归一化的多层感知机（MLP），且中间有跳跃连接。它还会在每隔一层时（如右图所示）在局部 NA（非自注意力机制）和稀疏全局 DiNA（动态非自注意力机制）之间进行切换。\n",
    "\n",
    "DiNAT在其架构中结合了NA和DiNA，从而创建了一个能够保持局部性、保持平移等变性，并在下游视觉任务中实现显著性能提升的Transformer模型。实验表明，与诸如 NAT、Swin 和 ConvNeXt 等强基线模型相比，DiNAT 在各种视觉识别任务中表现出明显的优势。"

    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "DiNAT 基于Neighborhood Attention (NA)架构，这是一种专门为计算机视觉任务设计的注意力机制，旨在高效地捕捉图像中像素之间的关系。简单来说，可以把它比作图像中每个像素需要理解并关注其周围像素，以更全面地理解整个图像。以下是NA的主要特性：\n",
    "\n",
    "* 局部关系：NA捕捉局部关系，使每个像素能够从其周围的邻域中获取信息。这类似于我们首先观察最近的物体来理解场景，然后再考虑整个视野的方式。\n",
    "* 感受野：NA允许像素扩展其对周围环境的理解，而无需增加过多计算量。它能够动态扩展像素的范围或“注意力范围”，在必要时将更远的邻居纳入其中。\n",
    "\n",
    "总的来说，NA 将注意力定位在像素的最近邻域上。DiNA 将 NA 的局部注意力扩展为一种约束更少的稀疏全局注意力，且不会增加额外的计算负担。由 NA 和 DiNA 组成的变换器能够保留局部性、保持平移等变性、以指数方式扩展感受野，并捕捉更长距离的相互依赖关系，从而在下游视觉任务中显著提升性能。"
